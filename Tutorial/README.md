# Tutorials
### Note: All tutorials were implemented using Anaconda Python 3 using Jupyter Notebooks. 
- ```TFBasics.py``` goes through some basic operations entailing TensorFlow 1.3.0 and Jupyter Notebooks
- ```SimpleGraph.py``` uses a simple graph and activation f(x) to solve classification problems using two feature sets. Also, while implementing a high-level overview of TensorFlow.
